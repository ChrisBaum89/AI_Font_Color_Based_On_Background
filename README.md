# AI_Practice_1

AI project that uses BrainJS to correctly guess the color a text should be based on the background.
- Black and White text is displayed on a background color
- User can select a Black or White button which appends the data array which can then be printed out
using the Print button.
- By updating the "data" with the printed out data the AI model becomes stronger.
